# NewTab page with Bookmarks

This Firefox extension is a replacement for the native newtab page.

It displays the toolbar bookmarks, using the same look and feel as the top-most sites of the native newtab page.

No search field, no top-most sites, only bookmarks.

## Example

These toolbar bookmarks:

![NewTab page with Bookmarks _(newtab-bm)_](public/screenshot-bookmarks-toolbar.png)

are displayed like that :

![NewTab page with Bookmarks _(newtab-bm)_](public/screenshot.png)
